## Casting Agency Project

The Casting Agency models a company that is responsible for creating movies and managing and assigning actors to those movies. You are an Executive Producer within the company and are creating a system to simplify and streamline your process.

## Getting Started

Installing Dependencies
Python 3.7
Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the python docs

## Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the python docs

## PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the /backend directory and running:

pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install all of the required packages we selected within the requirements.txt file.


## Running the server

From within the ./src directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

Each time you open a new terminal session, run:

export FLASK_APP=api.py;
To run the server, execute:

flask run --reload
The --reload flag will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

To run the Test (Using Python Unittest lib), execute:

python test_app.py
